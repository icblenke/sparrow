== DESCRIPTION:

  # Sparrow is a really fast lightweight queue written in Ruby that speaks memcached. 
  # That means you can use Sparrow with any memcached client library (Ruby or otherwise). 
  # 
  # Basic tests shows that Sparrow processes messages at a rate of 850-900 per second. 
  # The load Sparrow can cope with increases exponentially as you add to the cluster. 
  # Sparrow also takes advantage of eventmachine, which uses a non-blocking io, offering great performance.
  # 
  # Sparrow is a in-memory queue but will persist the data to disk when receiving a term signal.
  # 
  # Sparrow comes with built in support for daemonization and clustering. 
  # Also included are example libraries and clients. For example:
  # 
  # require 'memcache'
  # m = MemCache.new('127.0.0.1:11212')
  # m['queue_name'] = '1' # Publish to queue
  # m['queue_name']       #=> 1 Pull next msg from queue
  # m['queue_name']       #=> nil
  # m.delete('queue_name) # Delete queue
  # 
  # # or using the included client:
  # 
  # class MyQueue < MQ3::Queue
  #   def on_message
  #     logger.info "Received msg with args: #{args.inspect}"
  #   end
  # end
  # 
  # MyQueue.servers = [
  #   MQ3::Protocols::Memcache.new({:host => '127.0.0.1', :port => 11212, :weight => 1})
  # ]
  # MyQueue.publish('test msg')
  # MyQueue.run
  # 
  # Messages are deleted as soon as they're read and the order you add messages to the queue probably won't 
  # be the same order when they're removed.
  # 
  # Additional memcached commands that are supported are:
  # flush_all # Deletes all queues
  # version
  # quit
  # The memcached commands 'add', and 'replace' just call 'set'.
  # 
  # Call sparrow with --help for usage options
  # 
  # The daemonization won't work on Windows. 
  # 
  # Check out the code:
  # svn checkout http://sparrow.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sparrow
  # 
  # Sparrow was inspired by Twitter's Starling
